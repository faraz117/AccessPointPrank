    <b>Rickrolling</b>, alternatively <b>rick-rolling</b>, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised
    hyperlink. Those led to the music video believing that they were accessing some unrelated material (in this case, "FREE WiFi") are said to have been <i>rickrolled</i>. The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other
    situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.
